# Examples

### [Group A finished - With no third place](group_a_finished_nothirdplace.json)

* 1st place: TUR with 9 points, and a goal score of +2 (4-2), 3 games won
* 2nd place: WAL with 4 points, and a goal score of -1 (5-6), 1 won, 1 draw, 1 lost
* 3rd place: ITA with 2 points, and a goal score of -1 (3-4), 0 won, 2 draw, 1 lost
* 4th place: SUI with 2 points, and a goal score of -1 (3-4), 0 won, 2 draw, 1 lost

* As ITA has less disciplinary points they will end at 3rd place
* If ITA and SUI had the same disciplinary points the rank would be used to determine the placement

The 3rd and 4th place is equal, so either disciplinary points or highest position in overall ranking will be used, but as disciplinary is not tracked, it will be written on each group, when the group has been decided and all matches are finish.

* Match 49 - is finished, won by penalty

* Match 51 (final) - Only the first team has been found
